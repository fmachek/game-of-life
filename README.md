# Game of Life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that it "plays itself" after the initial input.

## Rules
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell

See [the Game of Life Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for more info.

## Features
### Manual input
Click on a cell to change its state.
### Reset
Reset the simulation and create a clean grid.
### Refresh rate
Change the simulation refresh rate in milliseconds. That is the time between individual generations.
### Generate
Tired of manually creating a unique grid of cells? Let the program generate a random grid of dead and living cells, resulting in a unique outcome.
